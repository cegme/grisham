\section{Summary}

We describe \system, a system for topic-based article search
and exploration given a user model.
This paper describes a promising search paradigm.
Any researcher who would like to do exploratory search or literature 
reviews will find the system beneficial. In the future, 
we would like to perform user studies to obtain feedback on the 
effectiveness of the three search paradigms.
