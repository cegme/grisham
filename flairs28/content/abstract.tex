We describe a demonstration of our system \system, presenting methods for topic-based paper exploration.
We use a topic modeling algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to derive topic distributions 
for each scientific paper in a DBLP citation data set. We allow users to specify personal topic distribution
to contextualize the exploration experience.
We demonstrate three types of exploration keyword search, topic based exploration
and citation-lineage search. In each model we shape the results to be specific
to a user specification. We describe the components of our web-based system.
