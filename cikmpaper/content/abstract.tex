In this abstract for a demo showing a method of topic based paper exploration.
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to derive topic models for each scientific
paper in the data set. We allow user's to specify their own topic distribution
to allow the user to explore a set of papers.
We demonstrate three types of exploration keyword search, topic based exploration
and citation-lineage search. In each model we shape the results to be specific
to a user specification. This demonstration show our web-based system.
