\section{Conclusion}

We describe \system, a system for topic-based paper search
and exploration given a user model.
This is a demonstration of a promising new search paradigm.
Any research who would like to do exploratory search or a literature 
reviews will find the system beneficial.
During the demonstration we will allow participants to freely
interact with the system.
We will discuss the algorithm and formulas that drive \system with attendees.
