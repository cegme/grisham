There have been previous systems to use topic modeling as a basis of
search and exploration. We are the first to our knowledge to incorporate
a user modeling into the loop. 

A system of note is Yang et al. \cite{yang2011topic} whom apply topic modeling to 
collections of historical news papers to assist search. They 
found that the topics generated from topic models are 
are generally good, however once the sets of topics are 
generated, an expert opinion is required to name them. 
In \system, we allow users to select numbered topics for article-search 
based on topically relevant words.
